# Inversion-of-complex-matrix
For the inverse of complex matrices, matlab's built-in function inv() may have errors, this program uses the LU decomposition to solve the inverse of the matrix and outputs the errors
The subroutine LU,solution_to_l\u in this program can be used to solve systems of linear equations
